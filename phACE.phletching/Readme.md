## special thanks:
- **aquafir**. i spammed you like a thousand times over a single weekend and you didnt block me. also you were surprisingly patient with my eli5 requests.
- **hells**. when i was complaining about being frustrated, you told me to quit and that gave me something to work against and finish this.
- **dekaru**. your implementation of a similar feature in classicACE/customDM is what pushed me to make this. hope you come back from your bike ride.
